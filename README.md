# RPS-Multiplayer

This web application is a rock-paper-scissors multiplayer game. It only enables two users in different computers to play each other at a time. The application keeps count of the times each player has won or lost and also has a chat feature that lets the users communicate (or insult) each other while they are connected. 

Once a user leaves the page, he/she is immediately disconnected and another user can join the game.

This application was made in oreder to learn more about Firebase's database features.
